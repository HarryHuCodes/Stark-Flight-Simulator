Stark flight simulator, inspired by the mobile game jetpack joyride is an “endless runner” where 
the user must dodge obstacles.
Upon launching the game, the player is greeted with a start screen. Pressing any key on the 
DE1-SOC will begin the game.

Once the game starts, the player must use the up and down 
arrows on the PS2 keyboard. to move up and down. The score increments every time an enemy 
reaches the end of the screen without touching the player. The player loses when a collision 
occurs. 
The bottom of the screen has a countdown bar that is green. If this bar goes yellow, and red, 
this indicates severely depleted time and that the game will soon end.
To run this project please compile the included c file main_interrupts.c and run on a DE1-SOC 
computer as normal, or in CPUlator.
